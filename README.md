# Python-And-C-Fun-Program

One day I am running C++ code using python Script. Then I had an idea, why we can run Python code in C++. then i run same python code to run c++ code ,before run this python code I changed some In My C++ program that is `system('<now_running_python_code>.py');`, and the program is not terminated,it was while running without Loop. 

>**It was New example of How to while run your code without using loop**ðŸ˜…


 This is `run_cpp.py` file
```python
#run_cpp.py
import os
    os.system('g++ run_py.cpp -o run_py')
    os.system('./run_py')
   
```
the above program compile and run the run_py.cpp

In the `run_py.cpp` file
```cpp
using namespace std;

int main() {
    system("python run_cpp.py");
    return 0;
}

```

>And What happen?

# Answer is 

Each Program not fully completed!

Each program run its code recursively. So the Each program creates a parent and child program.

When your are while running this program, may be system will be crashes.
